# Monthly Temperature Analysis

This repository contains an SQL query that calculates the monthly maximum, minimum, and average temperatures from a table of daily temperature records.

## Query Overview

The query processes the weather data and returns:
- The **maximum temperature** recorded in each month.
- The **minimum temperature** recorded in each month.
- The **average temperature** for each month (rounded to the nearest integer).

The data is grouped by month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and performs the necessary aggregations.
